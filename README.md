# :zap: Quick Start Guide

Here‚Äôs how to get started with React PDF in your React.js project:

## 1. Check Prerequsities

Here are the basic system requirements to run the React PDF component:

- React version: >= 18.0
- React version: >= 19.0

If you are working with a React framework such as Next and Gatsby, React PDF can run smoothly as long as you are using React 18 and above.

React PDF viewer also works well with other React.js UI libraries such as MUI, Ant Design and Chakra UI.

Although React PDF can run on most JavaScript module bundlers, it is more vigorously tested on Vite and Webpack.

_Remark: <br/>- If using TypeScript, it requires >= TypeScript 4.6._

### Browser support

| Chrome | Firefox | Edge | Safari | Safari iOS | Chrome Android |
| ------ | ------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| 115+   | 115+    | 115+ | 16.5+  | 16.5+      | 126+           |

## 2. Install the Package

There are a few ways you can install React PDF, namely `bun`, `npm`, `pnpm` or `yarn`.

### Using bun:

```bash
bun add @pdf-viewer/react
```

##### Caching of previous Worker version with `bun`

To clear cache, try running `bun pm cache rm` to remove cache in the global cache directory. If the error remains, try executing the following steps:

```shell
rm bun.lockb
rm -R node_modules
```

### Using npm:

```bash
npm install @pdf-viewer/react
```

### Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @pdf-viewer/react
```

### Using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @pdf-viewer/react
```

For more information on how to use different package managers, please visit our [installation guide](https://docs.react-pdf.dev/introduction/getting-started/#installation?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral).

## 3. Import and Use the Component

The following structure demonstrates how to build a React PDF viewer by importing and assembling components. This modular approach gives you the flexibility to customize the viewer as needed.

```tsx
  <RPConfig>               {/* Configuration license and pdfjs-dist worker */}
    <RPProvider>           {/* Viewer context provider */}
      <RPTheme>            {/* Theme customization (optional) */}
        <RPDefaultLayout>  {/* Default layout container */}
          <RPPages />      {/* PDF pages renderer */}
        </RPDefaultLayout>
      </RPTheme>
    </RPProvider>
  </RPConfig>
```

_Remark: For more information on each component, please refer to [Component](https://docs.react-pdf.dev/components/overview?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral)._

### Basic Usage

The most basic usage of React PDF viewer needs four components, namely: `RPConfig`, `RPProvider`, `RPDefaultLayout`, and `RPPages`.

Here's how to implement a basic PDF viewer in a React application:

```jsx
import { RPProvider, RPDefaultLayout, RPPages, RPConfig } from '@pdf-viewer/react'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <RPConfig>
      <RPProvider src="https://cdn.codewithmosh.com/image/upload/v1721763853/guides/web-roadmap.pdf">
        <RPDefaultLayout style={{ height: '660px' }}>
          <RPPages />
        </RPDefaultLayout>
      </RPProvider>
    </RPConfig>
  )
}
export default App
```

The PDF viewer will automatically adjust to fit its container's dimensions. You can control the size by setting the `style` prop on `RPDefaultLayout`.

### 4. Customize with Hooks and Props

To enhance React PDF further, we offer built-in hooks and props that let you fine-tune functionality, adjust appearance, and integrate custom behaviors into your application.

For detailed usage, refer to our [Documentation][reactpdf-docs].
